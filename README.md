### **Hey there! You have just stumbled upon a pretty ambitious project, so bear with me for a second :))**

This web application is part of a larger project that utilizes **drones to deliver essential supplies during rescue operations.** You can **learn more** about that [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C9ksqlWsc1P/?igsh=MTBkemp3Nmc3dWJrZQ==);  

The application is designed to provide **a straightforward and user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing drones.**

## Key Features:

1.  **`User Authentication:`**
    
    -   **Login Page:** A simple login page allows users to **securely access the system.**
2.  **`Main Dashboard:`**
    
    -   **Drone Tracking Map:** The **main page** features an **interactive map** that **visually represents the locations of drones using pins.** Users can quickly see where each drone is deployed.
    -   **Drone List with Management Options:** Alongside the **map**, users have access to **a list of all drones.** This list includes essential details like **drone ID and current status**, and features dropdown menus for further information.
3.  **`Drone Management:`**
    
    -   **Basic Operations:** Users can **add new drones** to the system by providing necessary details, and **remove drones** when they are no longer in use. **Admins** can also opt to **refuel** the drones.

### `Technical Implementation:`

-   **The frontend** is built using standard web technologies, including **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,** and might leverage frameworks like **React** for better component management.
- **The backend** is being designed to handle basic **API requests**, managing drone data efficiently to support the app's functionality.
-  The overall design is **minimalist** and focused on **core functionalities** to ensure ease of use and maintainability.
