# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

### **Hey there! You have just stumbled upon a pretty ambitious project, so bear with me for a second :))**

This web application is part of a larger project that utilizes **drones to deliver essential supplies during rescue operations.** You can **learn more** about that [here](https://www.instagram.com/p/C9ksqlWsc1P/?igsh=MTBkemp3Nmc3dWJrZQ==);  

The application is designed to provide **a straightforward and user-friendly interface for monitoring and managing drones.**

## Key Features:

1.  **`User Authentication:`**
    
    -   **Login Page:** A simple login page allows users to **securely access the system.**
2.  **`Main Dashboard:`**
    
    -   **Drone Tracking Map:** The **main page** features an **interactive map** that **visually represents the locations of drones using pins.** Users can quickly see where each drone is deployed.
    -   **Drone List with Management Options:** Alongside the **map**, users have access to **a list of all drones.** This list includes essential details like **drone ID and current status**, and features dropdown menus for further information.
3.  **`Drone Management:`**
    
    -   **Basic Operations:** Users can **add new drones** to the system by providing necessary details, and **remove drones** when they are no longer in use. **Admins** can also opt to **refuel** the drones.

### `Technical Implementation:`

-   **The frontend** is built using standard web technologies, including **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript,** and might leverage frameworks like **React** for better component management.
- **The backend** is being designed to handle basic **API requests**, managing drone data efficiently to support the app's functionality.
-  The overall design is **minimalist** and focused on **core functionalities** to ensure ease of use and maintainability.
